**Law makers, law breakers** is a citizen led project that aims to objectively document field evidence of democratic protest against the state and the stateâ€™s response to it.

# Data

All content submissions go into a firebase database and fact checked for authenticity by volunteers in a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSn7eqNU8lFk9EtrLCGaDZ9psVb-zoFJ0p7o3QiMhfzb9Op2roxJMZrwVCB8scA2yqJgFLX1bCZ8Nrm/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true).

The sheet is queried via [tapletop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabletop) and made available to the app as a JSON API: http://caaprotests.info/getVideoData
